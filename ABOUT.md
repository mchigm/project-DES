### What can DES do?
- DES uses Meta's Llama2 GPT model [License](Llama.LICENSE), which is able to chat like your assistant.
- DES uses Meta's Llama2 NLP model [License](), which is able to understand complex sentence-based expressions.
- DES uses a self-trained CNN model and stable diffusion model [License](Stability_ai.LICENSE), which is able to generate images based on prompts and NLP results.
- DES uses a self-trained SD-improvement model [Paper](), which is able to improve the picture's result by using a stable diffusion model [License](Stability_ai.LICENSE) and user's preference.
- DES supports R, Python, Mojo, and Javascript IDLE(**Library not supported**).
- DES supports local add-ons. [SEE HERE]()
- DES supports math calculation by using Python/Mojo's [Scipy](https://scipy.org) and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) library.
- DES supports algebraic calculation, simple arithmetic calculation, calculus calculation and analysis, probability calculation and visualization, graphing calculation, simple data extraction, and scientific transformations.
- DES supports picture-to-formula by using a self-trained CNN model.
- DES integrates calculation results by using Meta's Llama2 NLP model [License]() and Microsoft math [Website](https://math.microsoft.com).
- DES support LaTeX and Pybtex(BibTeX-compatible bibliography processor) generation by using Python's [PyLaTeX](https://github.com/JelteF/PyLaTeX) and [Pybtex!](https://pybtex.org/) libary.
- DES support [DAS](https://emperorowl.gitbook.io/das) APIs.
